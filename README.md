# Supervised-Skin-lesion-Segmentation
This repo contains a mini project on Supervised Skin lesion Segmentation on the HAM10000 Dataset.
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Its early diagnosis is pivotal for the complete elimination of malignant tumors from the human body. There is a lot of ongoing research on skin cancer detection, localization and classification. Segmentation is an essential step in localization of skin cancer. Segmentation is a technique used in computer vision to identify objects or boundaries to simplify an image and more efficiently analyze it. It is performed by dividing an image into different regions based on the characteristics of pixels. Binary Segmentation is used to divide two major regions of the image. Binary Segmentation in particular is used in skin cancer localization.
